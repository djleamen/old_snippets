Oh-oh-oh
Oh
Don't know what to say
One look and then you blew me away
I'm spiralling all over the place
So lifted, you got me reaching for grace
Body off the ground
Caught me by surprise
Like seeing shooting stars in the sky
There's danger in the dark of your eyes
But something 'bout you brings me to life
Got me here and now
Heart break already hit me once
They say that it won't happen twice
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh
So, tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh
So, tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Electrified with love on the line
So different every touch, every time
Connected by invisible wires
Don't you cut me out, oh-woah
Heart break already hit me once
So, swear that it won't happen twice
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh
So, tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh
So, tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
Uh-uh, uh, uh, uh-uh
Tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Lightning, lightning
Give it to ya, give it to ya (walk away, I'll follow my soul)
Blinded, blinded
Yeah, tell me what you want, tell me what you want
Li-li-li-li-li-li-lightning, li-li-li-li-li-li-lightning
Li-lightning
Yeah love, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
You struck me down like lightning, lightning
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it
So, tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like li-lightning
Blinded, blinded
You took me down, I don't mind it, mind it
My stupid heart can't fight it, fight it, uh
So, tell me what you want and I'ma give it to you
Like lightning
