Divide and Conquer
Michael Romeo
War of the Worlds, Pt. 2
2022
One by one - dissected with such extreme precision
Classified by type
It's begun - razor sharp, oh, that first incision
Strong and swift - speed of light
Eyes of envy watching from afar
Rip the skyline like a falling star
Unearthly silence dressed in black
The damage is done, now there's no turning back
Denying, defying - the dread's intensifying
It's all for one and one for all
Defiling, die trying - a storm electrifying
Divided we stand, united we fall
Victimized - the microscopic subdivisions
Bound by chains of fear
Paralyzed - we align for sure collision
Endless night draws ever near
Nightmare titans lacerate the sky
Through darkened clouds, the foe malign
Unearthly silence dressed in black
The damage is done, now there's no turning back
Denying, defying - the dread's intensifying
It's all for one and one for all
Defiling, die trying - a storm electrifying
Divided we stand, united we fall
